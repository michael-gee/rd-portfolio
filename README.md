# my-first-portfolio
One of my first projects made solely with HTML and CSS.

In this project I chose to use my own CSS instead of using Bootstrap because I do not plan to use Bootstrap in the future. This is because many developers told me it is not recommended to us it because of the overhead that comes with it.
